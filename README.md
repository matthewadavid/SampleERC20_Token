# SampleERC20_Token
Sample Project for creating an ERC20 Token 

The focus of this project is for to learn how to create a simple Token (AKA Coin) to run using the Ethereum Protocol. The tools for this project used Truffle to get started.

Be warned: this is a sample code for learning. You will want to test your own Token before releasing to the Ethereum Mainnet

Have fun coding!
